			<h2>“Fall Lawn Care: Preparing Your Grass for Winter’s Chill”</h1>
				<p>As the days get shorter and the air turns crisp, your lawn is quietly preparing for its long winter nap. Fall isn’t just about raking leaves — it’s one of the most important times to set your grass up for success in the spring.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Keep Mowing — but Lower the Blade</strong></li><br>
					<p>Continue mowing until your grass stops growing, typically after the first frost. Gradually lower your mower blade in the last couple of cuts, aiming for about 2 to 2.5 inches. This helps prevent snow mold while still protecting root systems.</p>
				<li><strong>Aerate the Soil</strong></li><br>
					<p>Fall is perfect for aeration because the soil is moist and the roots are actively growing. Aeration breaks up compacted soil, allowing water, nutrients, and oxygen to penetrate deeper.</p>
				<li><strong>Apply a Fall Fertilizer</strong></li><br>
					<p>A slow-release, high-potassium fertilizer will strengthen roots for winter and encourage faster green-up in spring.</p>
				<li><strong>Remove Leaves Promptly</strong></li><br>
					<p>Don’t let leaves smother your grass. Rake or mulch them weekly to keep your lawn breathing freely.</p>
				<div>🍂 Pro Tip: Schedule your aeration and fertilization on the same day for maximum benefit — the open soil plugs will help nutrients soak in quickly.</div>
			</ol>

			<h2> “The Fall Overseeding Guide: How to Fill in Bare Spots Before Winter”</h2>
				<p>If your lawn looks a little patchy after summer, fall is your best opportunity to bring it back to life. Cooler temperatures and consistent moisture create ideal conditions for seed germination.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Step 1: Choose the Right Grass Seed</strong></li>
					<p>Pick a variety that matches your existing lawn type (cool-season or warm-season). If you’re unsure, a local garden center can help identify your grass type</p>
				<li><strong>Step 2: Prepare the Soil</strong></li>
					<p>Loosen the top layer of soil with a rake or dethatcher. This creates a seedbed where roots can establish easily.</p>
				<li><strong>Step 3: Spread the Seed Evenly</strong></li>
					<p>Use a broadcast spreader for large areas or hand-spread in small patches. Lightly rake the seed into the soil so it makes good contact.</p>
				<li><strong>Step 4: Water Consistently</strong></li>
					<p>Keep the area moist — light watering once or twice a day until the seedlings reach about 3 inches tall.</p>
				<div>🌱 Pro Tip: Overseed right after aeration for even better results — the holes help protect seeds and improve germination rates.</div>

			<h2><strong>“Fall Weed Control: Stop Weeds Before They Take Over Next Spring”</strong></h2>
				<p>Fall isn’t just for planting — it’s the perfect season to fight back against weeds. Many broadleaf weeds are storing energy in their roots now, which makes herbicides more effective.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Identify Your Weeds</li>
					<p>Common fall culprits include dandelions, chickweed, and clover. Spot-treat isolated patches or apply a selective herbicide to your entire lawn if needed.</p>
				<li>Time Your Treatment</li>
					<p>Apply herbicides on a calm, dry day with temperatures between 50–85°F. This ensures the product sticks to leaves and gets absorbed.</p>
				<li> Maintain Healthy Grass</li>
					<p>Weeds thrive in bare or thin spots. Combine weed control with overseeding and fertilizing for a dense, competitive lawn.</p>
				<li>Don’t Forget the Edges</li>
					<p>Weeds often creep in from sidewalks, driveways, and flower beds — keep these areas trimmed and treated.</p>
				<div>🛡 Pro Tip: Pulling weeds after a rain is easier because the soil is soft, allowing you to remove the entire root.<div>
