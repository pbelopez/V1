		<h2>Watch Out for These Poisonous Shrubs (and Itchy Plants Too!)</h2>
			<p>Most of us want a yard that’s safe, relaxing, and pet-friendly. But here’s the thing—some shrubs and plants that look totally harmless can actually make you sick, cause a nasty rash, or even be life-threatening if ingested.<br>
			Whether you’re planning new landscaping or just curious about what’s growing around your home, here’s a quick guide to the poisonous shrubs (and a few infamous plants) you’ll want to keep an eye on.</p>

				<div class="card">
					<img src="neriumOleander.jpg">

					<h3>Oleander</h3>
			
				
					<p>Beautiful? Absolutely. Safe? Not even close. Every part of this plant is toxic to humans, pets, and even livestock. Just a small nibble of the leaves or flowers can cause serious heart problems.</p>
				</div>
			
			
				<div class="card">
					<img src="Azaleas2.jpg">
					<h3>Azaleas & Rhododendrons</h3>
					<p>These popular flowering shrubs look gorgeous in the spring, but they contain toxins that can make pets really sick—vomiting, drooling, even heart issues if enough is eaten.</p>
				</div>
			
		
				<div class="card">
					<img src="Yew.jpg">
					<h3>Yew</h3>
					<p>Often used as a hedge or foundation shrub, yews have those tempting red berries. But inside the seeds and needles is a toxin that can cause sudden heart failure in both people and animals.</p>
				</div>
			
			
				<div class="card">
					<img src="Hydrangea.jpg">
					<h3>Hydrangea</h3>
					<p>Hydrangeas aren’t as dangerous as some others, but eating the leaves or flowers can cause stomach pain, sweating, and nausea. Best to admire these from a distance.</p>

		<h2>The Itchy Trouble-Makers</h2>
			<p>These aren’t shrubs in the same way as oleander or hydrangea, but they’re just as notorious for making the outdoors less fun:

		<div class="grid">

			<div class="card">
				<img src="poisonIvy3.jpg" class="plant">
				<h3>Poison Ivy</h3>
				<p>The classic “leaves of three, let it be.” The oil (urushiol) causes an itchy, blistering rash that can spread if not cleaned off right away</p>
			</div>

			<div class="card">
				<img src="poisonOak.jpg" class="plant">
				<h3>Poison Oak</h3>
				<p>Similar to poison ivy, but with leaves that look more oak-like. Also loaded with urushiol, which is why brushing against it can ruin a weekend of yard work.</p>

		<h2>How to Stay Safe</h2>
			<ol style="max-width: 40rem; margin-inline: auto; text-align: center;">
				<li>Teach kids (and guests) the basics: Don’t eat berries or leaves from plants in the yard.</li>

				<li>Gloves are your friend: Wear them when trimming, weeding, or pulling mystery plants.</li>

				<li>Know your alternatives: Non-toxic shrubs like lilac, spirea, or forsythia can give you color without the risk.</li>

				<li>Remove hazards carefully: If you spot poison ivy or similar plants, use gloves and dispose of them properly—never burn them, since the smoke can carry toxins.</li>

				<li>Keep an eye on pets: Dogs especially may chew on leaves if bored.</li>
			</ol>

		<h2>Final Word</h2>
			<p>A little plant knowledge goes a long way. You don’t have to rip out every shrub in your yard, but it’s smart to know which ones can cause problems. With the right mix of caution and planning, you can keep your outdoor space both beautiful and safe.</p>
