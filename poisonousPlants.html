					<h3>Oleander</h3>
			
				
					<p>Beautiful? Absolutely. Safe? Not even close. Every part of this plant is toxic to humans, pets, and even livestock. Just a small nibble of the leaves or flowers can cause serious heart problems.</p>
				</div>
			
			
				<div class="card">
					<img src="Azaleas2.jpg">
					<h3>Azaleas & Rhododendrons</h3>
					<p>These popular flowering shrubs look gorgeous in the spring, but they contain toxins that can make pets really sick—vomiting, drooling, even heart issues if enough is eaten.</p>
				</div>
			
		
				<div class="card">
					<img src="Yew.jpg">
					<h3>Yew</h3>
					<p>Often used as a hedge or foundation shrub, yews have those tempting red berries. But inside the seeds and needles is a toxin that can cause sudden heart failure in both people and animals.</p>
				</div>
			
			
				<div class="card">
					<img src="Hydrangea.jpg">
					<h3>Hydrangea</h3>
					<p>Hydrangeas aren’t as dangerous as some others, but eating the leaves or flowers can cause stomach pain, sweating, and nausea. Best to admire these from a distance.</p>

		<h2>How to Stay Safe</h2>
			<div class="grid">
				<div class="item">
					<h4>Teach kids (and guests) the basics</h4>
					<p>Don’t eat berries or leaves from plants in the yard.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="item">
					<h4>Gloves are your friend</h4>
					<p>Wear them when trimming, weeding, or pulling mystery plants.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="item">
					<h4>Know your alternatives</h4>
					<p>Non-toxic shrubs like lilac, spirea, or forsythia can give you color without the risk.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="item">
					<h4>Remove hazards carefully</h4>
					<p>If you spot poison ivy or similar plants, use gloves and dispose of them properly—never burn them, since the smoke can carry toxins.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="item">
					<h4>Keep an eye on pets</h4>
					<p>Dogs especially may chew on leaves if bored.</p>
