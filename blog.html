            <h2>Beginner’s Guide to Lawn Care — Simple Steps for a Healthy Yard</h2>
            <p>If you’re new to lawn care, it can feel overwhelming. But the truth is, with a little know-how and consistency, anyone can have a lush, green yard. Here’s how to get started.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Know Your Grass Type</strong> – Different grasses thrive in different climates. Cool-season grasses like Kentucky bluegrass or fescue prefer northern climates, while warm-season types like Bermuda or zoysia love the heat.</li>
                <li><strong>Mow Smart</strong> – Never cut more than one-third of the grass blade at a time. Keep your mower blades sharp, and adjust cutting height seasonally — slightly higher in summer to protect roots.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Deep, Not Often</strong> – Give your lawn about 1 inch of water per week, ideally in the early morning. Deep watering encourages strong root growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilize for Growth</strong> – Use a slow-release fertilizer in spring and fall. Follow instructions carefully — more is not always better.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep Weeds in Check</strong> – Pull weeds when the soil is moist or use a pre-emergent in early spring to stop them before they start.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="tip">✅ Tip: Take a “before” photo now. In a few months, you’ll be surprised at the transformation.</div>

            <h2>Top 5 Common Lawn Weeds & How to Get Rid of Them</h2>
            <p>Weeds are a lawn’s biggest uninvited guests. Here’s how to spot them — and stop them.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Dandelions</strong> – Yellow flowers, fluffy seed heads. Control by pulling before seeds form or using a selective broadleaf herbicide.</li>
                <li><strong>Crabgrass</strong> – Low, sprawling growth with coarse leaves. Control with pre-emergent herbicide in early spring; maintain thick turf.</li>
                <li><strong>Clover</strong> – Three-leaf clusters with white flowers. Control by maintaining nitrogen levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Chickweed</strong> – Small white flowers, low growth. Pull before seeding; mulch bare spots.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutsedge</strong> – Grass-like with triangular stems. Use specialized herbicides.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="tip">✅ Tip: Healthy, thick turf is the best weed prevention — weeds hate competition.</div>
