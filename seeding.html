      <p>Seeding is one of the most cost-effective ways to establish or rejuvenate turf. Done right, it fills bare spots, improves density, and increases disease resistance. This guide walks through the when, how, and why of seeding so you can get a lush, resilient lawn.</p>

      <h2>When to Seed</h2>
      <p>Timing matters. For cool-season grasses (fescue, rye, bluegrass), seed in early fall for best results — cooler nights and warm soil encourage germination and root growth. Spring seeding can work but expect more competition from weeds and a shallower root system.</p>

      <h2>Types of Seeding</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>New Lawn Seeding:</strong> Starting from bare soil; requires thorough soil prep and consistent moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Overseeding:</strong> Broadcasting seed over an existing lawn to boost density and patch thin areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Spot Seeding:</strong> For small bare patches; remove dead grass, loosen soil, add seed and mulch.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Soil Preparation</h2>
      <p>Good soil preparation multiplies your chances of success. Steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Test soil pH (ideal 6.0–7.0 for most turf) and amend if needed.</li>
        <li>Mow low and rake to remove debris and thatch.</li>
        <li>Loosen compacted soil with a tiller or aerator; add ¼–½ in of topsoil or compost if the soil is poor.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Choosing Seed</h2>
      <p>Pick varieties suited to your climate, sun exposure, and use. Use blends or mixes for resilience — they combine fast-germinating and durable varieties. Look for high germination rates and weed-free seed labels.</p>

      <h2>Seeding Steps (Basic)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Spread seed evenly — use a broadcast spreader for large areas or hand-seed small spots.</li>
        <li>Lightly rake to ensure seed-to-soil contact; press with a roller if available.</li>
        <li>Cover seed with a thin layer (¼ inch) of compost or soil to retain moisture.</li>
        <li>Mulch with straw on slopes or bare soil to protect and conserve moisture.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Watering Schedule</h2>
      <p>Keep newly seeded areas consistently moist (not soggy). A typical schedule:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>First 2 weeks:</strong> Light waterings 2–4 times daily depending on weather to keep the top ¼ inch moist.</li>
        <li><strong>Weeks 2–6:</strong> Gradually reduce frequency and increase depth to encourage deeper roots.</li>
        <li><strong>After 6–8 weeks:</strong> Transition to normal lawn watering — deep and infrequent.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Seeding during heat waves — seeds dry out and fail to establish.</li>
        <li>Skipping soil prep — seed on hard or compacted soil won’t germinate well.</li>
        <li>Overfertilizing young seedlings — use a starter fertilizer at recommended rates only.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quick FAQ</h2>
      <p><strong>Can I seed and sod the same yard?</strong> Yes — sod for instant coverage and seed to fill gaps or expand varieties.</p>
      <p><strong>How long until I can mow?</strong> Mow when grass reaches about 3–3.5 inches and is well-rooted, usually 3–4 weeks depending on growth rates.</p>
